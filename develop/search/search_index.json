For example for every AWS Role you wish to assume via AWS SSO you have to write a block like this (<code>aws-vault</code> or AWS CLI v2):</p> <pre><code>[profile MyUniqueProfileName]\nsso_start_url = https://foobar.awsapps.com/start\nsso_region = us-east-1\nsso_account_id = 012345678912\nsso_role_name = MyRoleName\n</code></pre> <p>If you have 10 roles, that's 10 blocks.  Or 100 roles, well it's 100 blocks. And every time you are given access to a new role (maybe a new AWS Account?) you have to go in, select a unique profile name and write the block. At some point users start complaining because this is \"unmanageable\" and \"hard to use\".</p> <p>But remember it's called Single Sign On... why are we defining generally global values like <code>sso_start_url</code> or <code>sso_region</code> over and over again?</p> <p>Also, because of how SSO works with PermissionSets, it's quite likely a user will have the same <code>sso_role_name</code> in many different AWS Accounts but we have a flat namespace of <code>profile</code> names to work with. This might work fine for users who only need to access a handful of accounts and roles, but at scale (and AWS SSO is obviously designed for larger organizations) this becomes a problem that each user must deal with and neither AWS CLI tooling or <code>aws-vault</code> really provide any substantive help.</p>"},{"location":"aws-vault/#how-aws-sso-cli-is-different","title":"How AWS SSO CLI is different","text":"<p>AWS SSO CLI on the otherhand started life focused on integrating with AWS SSO.

And yes, multiple SSO Instances are supported!</li> <li>Users are not required to pre-define the AWS Accounts or Roles they     wish to access.  This is auto-discovered by <code>aws-sso</code> via the AWS API.</li> <li>The <code>aws-sso</code> configuration file has a simple hierarchy which eliminates     the need to repeat the same configuration block or statements.     Don't repeat yourself!</li> <li>Naming is hard!  Instead of forcing you to give each role a single unique     name, <code>aws-sso</code> offers multiple ways to select a role at any time:<ul> <li>Users can select a role via an interactive search prompt using tags-     just like you have with Gmail.  Tags include all the metadata that the     AWS SSO API exposes as well as any user defined key/value pairs.</li> <li>For people who don't like interactive searches, you can select using     a <code>profile</code> value which is automatically generated via a powerful     template engine OR by any user defined value.  Yes, you can even use     the template for some roles and the user defined <code>profile</code> name for     your most commonly used roles.</li> <li>You can always select via standardized values like the Role ARN or     AccountId and RoleName.</li> <li>Of course, non-interactive (CLI) selection of roles supports     tab-completion!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Migrating to AWS SSO?  <code>aws-sso</code> is here to help.  It supports     discovering all your AWS SSO roles and writing entries to your     <code>~/.aws/config</code> file for you.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p> <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p> <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p> <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p> <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p> <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p> <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p> <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>"},{"location":"license/#terms-and-conditions","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS","text":""},{"location":"license/#0-definitions","title":"0.
