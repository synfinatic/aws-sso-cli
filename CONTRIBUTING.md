# Contributing

Hi!  I just wanted to say, if you're thinking of contributing to `aws-sso`
I'm excited to have all the help I can get. :)  That said, having worked
on this for a few years I've definitely got some opinions regarding how
things should work.  Some of those opinions are certainly right and others
are undoubtably wrong.  The trick is of course figuring out which is
which.

With that said, please reach out before you start working on a new
feature so we can discuss.  Easiest way is to 
[open a feature request](
https://github.com/synfinatic/aws-sso-cli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
and start a conversation.

Thanks!
